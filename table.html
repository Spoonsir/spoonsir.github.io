		<td> Math.random() is something you can use in a function to randomly generate a number. You set a var to Math.round(used to round to the nearest whole number)(Math.random()*number). The number is the limit to what random number can be generated but really you add one becuase 0 is included as a number. This also goes with arrays, setting a var to multiple things.</td>
