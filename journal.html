This week I learned a lot about comp sci about different stuff. I didnt understand like half the things but I think that I understand them now. Also we got to watch a cool video about some guy who made his own paraglider.

So far in comp sci I think I learned some stuff. I am still high key confused and need a lot of help but I think I can get better. Also the code pen stuff was confsuing but in the end I think I did it corretly. At least I hope I did.

Journal #3:

I have learned a good amount I think in comp sci. I like all the cool animation stuff and used it as my website. I think I messed up my website and stuff tho, should make a lab. I have gotten the hang of this but still need to learn more stuff. Also the terms are still confusing and I dont remeber them all.

Journal #4:

we are doing animations in class now and I think they are rly fun. I put some on my website but I made them uneven on purpose which is making me mad. Im pretty sure the animation is just moving the square a certain amount every like frame or smt but I made a cool animation which was the only thing I could make.

Journal #6:
I had a good amount fo trouble doing the quilt project. I had to make like 2 labs but I understood it in the end. I needed to put the add event listener inside the "recipe" of the quilts. The quilts work by first creating them, using a function which creates a certain amount of square based on the variable I. Then I used an add event listener to make it so when you click on a square the background image changes. I can set it to how many images I want by adding images to the folder and naming them blank.jpg with blank being a number.
