This week I learned a lot about comp sci about different stuff. I didnt understand like half the things but I think that I understand them now. Also we got to watch a cool video about some guy who made his own paraglider.

So far in comp sci I think I learned some stuff. I am still high key confused and need a lot of help but I think I can get better. Also the code pen stuff was confsuing but in the end I think I did it corretly. At least I hope I did.

I have learned a good amount I think in comp sci. I like all the cool animation stuff and used it as my website. I think I messed up my website and stuff tho, should make a lab. I have gotten the hang of this but still need to learn more stuff. Also the terms are still confusing and I dont remeber them all.

we are doing animations in class now and I think they are rly fun. I put some on my website but I made them uneven on purpose which is making me mad. Im pretty sure the animation is just moving the square a certain amount every like frame or smt but I made a cool animation which was the only thing I could make.

I had a good amount fo trouble doing the quilt project. I had to make like 2 labs but I understood it in the end. I needed to put the add event listener inside the "recipe" of the quilts. The quilts work by first creating them, using a function which creates a certain amount of square based on the variable I. Then I used an add event listener to make it so when you click on a square the background image changes. I can set it to how many images I want by adding images to the folder and naming them blank.jpg with blank being a number.

I just made some valentines thing for my sister which I find really funny but she may not. Also right now my body hurts cus I have a bunch of bruises from basketball. Also Im doing that phone project thingy and taking photos of citi bikes which is weird cus I feel like a tourist in my own citi. My volleyball practice was also really fun cus I did some matrix stuff by bending backwards and dodgeing a ball hit at my face. Overall comp sci is also really fun and I think I am learning a good amount of stuff but Im always to tired to want to do anything in this class. Honestly Im just always tired cus I never get enough leave which is mist likely my fault for not going to sleep early enough but also I have to do work and stuff so I blame the school.

we just did some car thingy in class where we make a div move when you click a key. It was cool and I made a sun that changes the background when it gets to a certain point. The code basiclly works by having an Event Listener with the keydown part set to a specific key code, which is different for each key. Then you make the top or left of a div change a certain value and it makes it look like its moving. You also have to set the divs left or top to a variable to when you do the Event Listener you change the variable which changes the position. Also you have to set the divs position to absolute becuase if you dont the div wont move. For my specific project I thought it was really cool cus I made it change the background color after a specific left value. This gave the impression the sun made it day altough there should be an epilesy warning cus its really bright.
