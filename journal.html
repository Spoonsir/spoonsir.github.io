<p> This week I learned a lot about comp sci about different stuff. I didnt understand like half the things but I think that I understand them now. Also we got to watch a cool video about some guy who made his own paraglider.

So far in comp sci I think I learned some stuff. I am still high key confused and need a lot of help but I think I can get better. Also the code pen stuff was confsuing but in the end I think I did it corretly. At least I hope I did.

	I have learned a good amount I think in comp sci. I like all the cool animation stuff and used it as my website. I think I messed up my website and stuff tho, should make a lab. I have gotten the hang of this but still need to learn more stuff. Also the terms are still confusing and I dont remeber them all.
